• Fracture analysis and crack growth in metal, and plastic 
• Thermo-mechanical structural analysis 
Conducted thermo-mechanical simulation for metallic structure to research
structural behavior at different environments; simulation includes static,
dynamic and thermal analysis; Coupled simulations at different time scales
(creep and fretting wear) to research contact force relaxation; Formulated
various ABAQUS subroutines (UEL, UEXPAN, CREEP, etc.)
