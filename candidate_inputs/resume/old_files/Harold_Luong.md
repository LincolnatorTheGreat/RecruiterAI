Experience
Lockheed Martin
18 years 11 months
Staff Mechanical Engineer
August 2015 - Present  (10 years 3 months)
Sunnyvale, CA
Technical Lead for the Structures, Mechanisms, and Thermal Control (SMT)
Products team responsible for the compatibility of SMT products on the
Payload Assembly for a new Satellite program. Provided daily tasking and
technical direction to team of four product managers and 10 engineers.
Developed Systems Engineering performance requirements to define
Structures and Mechanisms products. Led major design reviews for Program
Startup (SRR), at preliminary design completion milestone (PDR), and prior
to start of manufacturing (CDR). Iterated product designs to incorporate trade
studies and evolving requirements. Architected forward thinking solutions
to complex mechanical problems and led multidisciplinary teams to define
and execute plans to resolve those problems. Drove design maturation and
hardware development within cost, schedule, and technical constraints.

Design engineer responsible for designing mechanical components,
assemblies, electrical layouts, and wire harnesses for A2100 geosynchronous
satellite solar arrays for commercial programs. Provided detailed 3D models,
2D drawings, and BOMs for those designs.
Led design development, manufacturing process validation, mechanical and
thermal qualification testing, and readiness reviews of new graphite composite
solar panels and solar array wing booms. 
Provided technical and program oversight to external vendors and interfaced
extensively with internal manufacturing engineers, technician teams,
procurement, and program customers during fabrication of flight hardware to
meet program milestones.
University of California, Davis
Graduate Assistant Researcher
January 2004 - December 2006  (3 years)
Davis, CA
Conducted applied research on fatigue life extension in various aerospace
metal alloys using laser shock peening, in partnership with Lawrence
Livermore National Labs and Metal Improvement Company. Performed
high cycle fatigue life studies, surface engineering experiments, and various
materials evaluations to optimize laser peening treatment for aerospace,
nautical, and orthopedic applications. Research findings for laser peening on
fatigue life extension and the effects of laser peening-induced surface damage
were accepted for publication in an international mechanical and materials
engineering journal.
