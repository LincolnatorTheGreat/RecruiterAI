Job Title: Senior Free-Piston Systems Engineer
Location: Remote (US-based)
Company: Mainspring Energy

Overview:
Mainspring Energy is pioneering clean energy with our free-piston linear generator technology. We're hiring a Senior Free-Piston Systems Engineer to advance the design and control of our opposed-piston systems for efficient, fuel-flexible power generation.

Responsibilities:
- Design and simulate free-piston linear motion, focusing on opposed pistons oscillating without crankshafts or mechanical linkages.
- Develop software algorithms for real-time piston motion control, optimizing compression ratios for low-temperature combustion cycles.
- Conduct thermal and dynamic analysis of free-piston assemblies using tools like MATLAB/Simulink or Python for multi-fuel (e.g., hydrogen, biogas) compatibility.
- Prototype and validate modular free-piston units, ensuring >50% efficiency and ultra-low emissions through precise oscillation management.
- Collaborate on scaling from single-cylinder prototypes to multi-MW dispatchable systems.

Requirements:
- 5+ years in mechanical or controls engineering, with direct experience in free-piston engines or linear generators.
- Expertise in software-controlled piston dynamics, electromagnetics, and combustion modeling.
- Proficiency in simulation software (MATLAB, Python, ANSYS) and CAD for free-piston components.
- Strong understanding of fuel-flexible systems and low-carbon fuels.
- BS/MS in Mechanical Engineering, Aerospace, or related field.

What We Offer:
Competitive salary, equity, and the chance to shape the future of dispatchable clean power.
