Job description:

Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings

The Challenge

The Rings team is responsible for the design, analysis, and optimization
of the sealing ring and piston assemblies. These assemblies must contain
pressures far in excess of 100 bar and withstand gas temperatures up to
1500C, all while traversing a half-meter stroke 10 times per second. To
achieve oil-free, low-emissions operation, we make our rings out of
graphite – a brittle material that can oxidize at high temperature, and
wears out over time. All interfacing metal components are made from
high-temperature superalloys. Increasing the interval between ring
services is critical to Mainspring’s success as a company, with top
executives contributing directly to the program. As a Senior Mechanical
Engineer on this team, you will help to drive one of the most important
development programs at the company.

Responsibilities

- Lead R&D Projects: Drive ring development projects from initial
  concept through to production. This includes setting project
  requirements, developing novel designs, and creating production plans.

- Design & Analysis: Design complex moving parts for the piston and ring
  system. This involves using CAD and structural FEA to optimize designs
  that can operate in a multiphysical environment with high pressure and
  temperature.

- Root Cause Investigations: Assess and troubleshoot failure modes that
  are driven by complex thermal, structural, materials, and fluid
  interactions. Understand surrounding subsystems and their impact on
  ring performance.

- Testing and Validation: Design and run effective test campaigns using
  both benchtop rigs and in-generator experiments to validate designs
  and accelerate learning.

- Collaboration: Work closely with a talented cross-functional
  engineering team in a fast-paced, iterative environment.
