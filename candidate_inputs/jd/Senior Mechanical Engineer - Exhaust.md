Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System

Job Overview

Are you passionate about using your engineering skills to combat climate change? Mainspring Energy is looking for a creative and driven Senior Mechanical Engineer to help us perfect a key component of our groundbreaking Linear Generator: the exhaust system. This is more than just a job; it's a chance to solve complex challenges in performance, acoustics, and structural design, all while helping to build a cleaner, more sustainable energy future. If you're excited by hands-on work and want to make a tangible impact, we want to hear from you.
Responsibilities
●	Design for a Better World: Play a vital role in the entire design lifecycle of our low-emission exhaust subsystems. You'll take ideas from concept and analysis (FEA/CFD) to 3D modeling (Solidworks), prototyping, and validation testing.
●	Solve Tough Challenges: Tackle fascinating engineering problems unique to exhaust systems, from selecting materials that withstand extreme temperatures to designing for durability in high-vibration environments and integrating emissions control and acoustic-damping technologies.
●	Collaborate and Innovate: Work closely with a brilliant cross-functional team of engineers to integrate your designs and bring our next-generation products to life, contributing to a culture of continuous improvement.
●	Validate and Perfect: Plan and execute rigorous testing to ensure your designs are robust, reliable, and ready to perform in the real world, meeting demanding requirements for performance, safety, and durability.
●	Grow Your Skills: Stay at the forefront of mechanical engineering for clean power generation, continuously learning and identifying new opportunities to make our technology more efficient and cost-effective.
Qualifications
●	A background in designing systems that operate in high-temperature and high-vibration environments.
●	Solid engineering fundamentals in thermo-fluid systems and structural mechanics.
●	An understanding of how to design for durability, fatigue, and long-term reliability.
●	Proficiency with a 3D CAD package (we use Solidworks) and creating engineering drawings (GD&T).
●	Knowledge of common manufacturing processes like sheet metal fabrication, welding, and casting.
●	Hands-on experience with prototyping, assembling, and testing hardware.
●	Familiarity with analysis tools (FEA, CFD) to guide your design decisions.
●	Exposure to acoustic or emissions control hardware is a great plus!
What You Bring to the Table:
●	A degree in Mechanical Engineering or a related field.
●	A strong background in mechanical design, typically demonstrated by 5+ years of professional experience. We're more interested in your skills and passion than a specific number.
●	Experience taking designs from the drawing board to reality, preferably with complex hardware projects in fields like power generation, industrial equipment, or automotive systems.
●	A natural curiosity and a drive to build, test, and create innovative solutions.
