Dear Harold,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in manufacturing processes for graphite composite components and mechanical and thermal qualification testing, including high cycle fatigue analysis. This experience would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role, especially in enabling long-term durability of our advanced piston seal assemblies.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive experience in the design, development, and manufacturing of graphite composite structures for demanding aerospace applications.
- Your proven track record in conducting mechanical and thermal qualification testing, including high cycle fatigue studies and materials evaluation, to ensure hardware longevity.

The challenge is that the rings in our linear generator must contain pressures far in excess of 100 bar and withstand gas temperatures up to 1500C, all while traversing a half-meter stroke 10 times per second, using graphite – a brittle material that can oxidize and wears out over time.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
