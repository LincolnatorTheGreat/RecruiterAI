Hi Kidus,

I came across your profile and was immediately struck by how closely your background aligns with our work at Mainspring Energy. Your expertise in mechanical component design, FEA, and Solidworks expertise along with your strength in designing complex systems for high-temperature and high-vibration environments, including robust prototyping and validation, directly connects to the challenges we're tackling with our ultra-low emission linear generator technology. Your skill set could be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

The opportunity:
Our Linear Generator requires perfecting our exhaust system for optimal performance, acoustics, and structural integrity, especially as we integrate advanced emissions control and design for durability in demanding high-temperature and high-vibration operational conditions, crucial for achieving our near-zero NOx emissions profile via flameless combustion.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute chat?

Best regards,
