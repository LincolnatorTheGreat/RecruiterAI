Dear Jane Smith,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in free-piston linear generator control, like developing real-time control algorithms for opposed-piston systems, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your experience developing real-time control algorithms for opposed-piston linear generators, crucial for the controlled dynamics that enable ultra-low emissions.
- Your optimization of low-temperature combustion using Python and Simulink, directly relevant to achieving near-zero NOx in our free-piston architecture.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston linear generator control and low-temperature combustion optimization could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
