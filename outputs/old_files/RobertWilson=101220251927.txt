Dear Robert Wilson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **R&D on free-piston systems**, like **ammonia-fueled free-piston systems**, would be a game-changer for our **Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings** role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- **leading R&D on ammonia-fueled free-piston systems, directly addressing fuel agility for our linear generators.**
- **ensuring reliability under variable loads, a critical factor for minimizing maintenance and extending ring service intervals.**

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, and leveraging their freedom for **ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics**. I'd love to discuss how your background in **free-piston linear generator technology and low-carbon fuels** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
