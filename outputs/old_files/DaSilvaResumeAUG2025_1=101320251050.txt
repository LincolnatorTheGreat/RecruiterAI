Dear Robert A. DaSilva,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **structural dynamics and performance analysis of high-temperature components**, like **optimizing components for high-frequency linear oscillation**, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive experience in **FEA and material science for high-temperature components**, particularly in predicting **thermal mechanical fatigue and vibratory response** for turbine engine rings and seals, directly translates to our challenges with graphite and superalloy ring assemblies.
- Your proven ability to **lead R&D projects from concept to production** and conduct **root cause investigations** for complex mechanical systems, as demonstrated in your work with transmissions and missile launch systems, is vital for improving ring service intervals.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, emphasizing precise, controlled dynamics for ultra-low emissions. I'd love to discuss how your background in **high-temperature component design and dynamic system optimization** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
