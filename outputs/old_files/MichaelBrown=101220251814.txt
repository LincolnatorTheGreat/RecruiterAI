Dear Michael Brown,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in thermal analysis, especially with opposed-piston assemblies, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work performing thermal analysis on opposed-piston assemblies using ANSYS. This directly relates to designing complex moving parts for our piston and ring system.
- Your success optimizing low-temperature combustion for ultra-low NOx. This is critical as we strive for ultra-low emissions via precise, complete fuel-lean reactions enabled by our free-piston design.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston thermal analysis and combustion optimization could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
