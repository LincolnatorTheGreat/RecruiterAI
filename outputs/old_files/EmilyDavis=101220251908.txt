Dear Emily Davis,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in building and testing modular free-piston units, especially within the context of opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Building and testing modular free-piston units from kW to MW scale
- Collaboration on biogas and ammonia fuel prototypes, which directly supports our mission for ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics and fuel flexibility

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in prototyping and development of free-piston systems could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
