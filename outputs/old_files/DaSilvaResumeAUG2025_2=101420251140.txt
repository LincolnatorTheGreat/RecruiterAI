Dear Robert,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in advanced Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and materials science, like optimizing designs for extreme thermal, structural, and vibratory loads within moving mechanical assemblies, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive background in advanced FEA (ANSYS, SolidWorks Simulation) for metallic and composite structures, including non-linear, thermal, and vibratory analysis of turbine engine components and seals, directly aligns with designing our complex piston and ring systems.
- Your proven ability in root cause investigations and predicting component life under severe conditions like low cyclic fatigue, thermal mechanical fatigue, and creep, is crucial for increasing the durability of our critical graphite rings and piston assemblies.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires designing and optimizing brittle graphite sealing rings and piston assemblies to contain pressures exceeding 100 bar and temperatures up to 1500°C. This must be achieved while minimizing wear and oxidation for extended oil-free, ultra-low emissions operation, central to our free-piston technology.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short, 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
