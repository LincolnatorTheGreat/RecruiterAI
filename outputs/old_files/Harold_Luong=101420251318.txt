Dear Harold,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in the design, development, and manufacturing of graphite composite components and your experience with mechanical design solutions for complex structural components, which relates to Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator's high-performance piston and ring system, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive background in developing original mechanical design solutions for composite structures, particularly graphite components, is highly relevant to our graphite ring assemblies.
- Your experience leading mechanical and thermal qualification testing and troubleshooting failure modes for complex hardware aligns perfectly with our need to validate designs and increase the service interval of our ring assemblies.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires designing, analyzing, and optimizing sealing rings and piston assemblies to contain pressures far in excess of 100 bar and withstand gas temperatures up to 1500°C for ultra-low emissions operation.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short, 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
