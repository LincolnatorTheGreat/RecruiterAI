Dear Robert A. DaSilva,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **advanced mechanical design and analysis**, like **optimizing high-pressure, high-temperature sealing and piston assemblies for durability and efficiency**, would be a game-changer for our **Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings** role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your direct experience in structural FEA and CAD for critical engine components, including seals and ring support assemblies in high-temperature superalloys, which is directly applicable to our challenging piston and sealing ring designs.
- Your proven ability to conduct root cause investigations, evaluate component life against complex failure modes (like thermal mechanical fatigue and creep), and design robust test campaigns for advanced materials (including composites).

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in **high-performance mechanical systems, advanced materials, and structural integrity** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
