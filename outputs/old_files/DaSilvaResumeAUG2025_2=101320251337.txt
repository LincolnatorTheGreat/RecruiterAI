Dear Robert A. DaSilva,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in high-fidelity mechanical design and finite element analysis, like optimizing components that endure extreme temperatures and pressures within linear motion systems, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive experience in structural FEA and CAD for complex moving parts, particularly for turbine engines and missile systems, which operate under extreme thermal and pressure loads, directly relates to our piston and ring assembly challenges.
- Your deep understanding of advanced materials, including composites and metallic structures, is critical for designing and validating our graphite rings and high-temperature superalloy interfaces for ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in the design, analysis, and validation of critical components for high-performance linear generators could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
