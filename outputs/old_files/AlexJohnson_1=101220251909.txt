Dear Alex Johnson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in designing linear alternators for free-piston generators, like optimizing power output through direct conversion of linear motion, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your direct work designing linear alternators for free-piston generators, achieving >50% efficiency, showcases a deep understanding of our core architecture and its superior efficiency from free-piston architecture.
- Your experience conducting electromagnetic simulations for hydrogen-compatible systems aligns perfectly with our focus on fuel agility, seamlessly handling hydrogen and enabling near-zero emissions.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston generator system optimization and hydrogen fuel compatibility could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
Your Dad's Name
