Dear Jordan Lee,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in software-controlled opposed piston dynamics, like precise oscillation of opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, would be a game-changer for our Senior Free-Piston Systems Engineer role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your experience engineering software control systems for free-piston linear generators, achieving 53% efficiency with hydrogen-fueled prototypes
- Your skill in implementing real-time algorithms in Python/MATLAB for low-temperature combustion and multi-fuel operation

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in software-managed low-temperature combustion and fuel flexibility could drive our next-gen prototypes, helping us achieve ultra-low emissions through precise oscillation management. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
Alex Chen
