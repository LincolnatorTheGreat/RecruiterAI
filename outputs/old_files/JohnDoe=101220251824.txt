Dear John Doe,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in designing free-piston prototypes, like opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your assistance in designing free-piston prototypes for hydrogen fuel systems.
- Your experience performing thermal analysis using MATLAB, crucial for complex thermal interactions within piston and ring systems.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in advanced free-piston design and analysis could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
