Dear Jordan Lee,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in advanced free-piston generator design, like engineering software control systems for opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work in CAD modeling and ANSYS simulations for free-piston assemblies, critical for optimizing designs in high-pressure, high-temperature environments.
- Your experience with software-controlled piston dynamics, enabling precise oscillation and managing low-temperature combustion for high efficiency and minimal emissions.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving near-zero NOx through precise reactions. I'd love to discuss how your background in high-efficiency, low-emission free-piston prototypes could drive our next-gen ring and piston development. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
