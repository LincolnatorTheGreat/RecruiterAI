Dear Alex Johnson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in linear alternator design, particularly optimizing efficiency in free-piston generator systems, is highly relevant to the overarching technology that our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings team advances.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work designing linear alternators for free-piston generators, achieving over 50% efficiency.
- Your experience conducting electromagnetic simulations for hydrogen-compatible systems and testing for low-emission performance.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, utilizing advanced piston control and direct conversion of linear motion into electricity. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston linear generator design and fuel compatibility could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
