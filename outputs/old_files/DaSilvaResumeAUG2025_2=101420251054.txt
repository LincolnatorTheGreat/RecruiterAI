Dear ROBERT A. DASILVA,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **advanced mechanical design and finite element analysis**, like optimizing critical components such as seals and piston assemblies for the extreme conditions within our free-piston linear generators, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive background in **structural FEA (ANSYS, SolidWorks Simulation)** for metallic and composite structures, especially in demanding high-temperature applications like turbine engines, directly aligns with our needs for optimizing brittle graphite rings and superalloy interfaces.
- Your proven expertise in **material science, component design, and root cause analysis** for complex, moving parts, including seals and rings, is crucial for enhancing the long-term durability of our advanced oil-free piston assemblies, a key focus for Mainspring's technology.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, with a critical focus on the durability of components like the piston seals. I'd love to discuss how your background in high-performance mechanical design and materials engineering could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
Mainspring Energy Technical Recruiter
