Dear Sarah Lee,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in software for piston motion control, critical to achieving ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Built software for piston motion control in free-piston linear generators.
- Integrated Python scripts for adaptive compression ratios.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in software-driven optimization of free-piston dynamics, which directly impacts the complex operating conditions for our sealing ring and piston assemblies, could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
