Dear Hai,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and thermo-mechanical coupling analysis that relates to Mainspring Energy's critical focus on piston and ring system durability, and would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your strong background in structural FEA and multi-physics simulations for high-temperature applications.
- Your proven ability to model material behaviors, including wear and fracture, at extreme temperatures.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires designing durable, oil-free piston and sealing ring assemblies from advanced materials, operating under extreme conditions (1500C, >100 bar pressure, rapid oscillation) to maximize service intervals. This aligns perfectly with your PhD focus and professional experience.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
