Dear Sophia Rodriguez,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in optimizing for low-emissions operation in free-piston designs, like achieving near-zero NOx emissions, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your experience ensuring ultra-low NOx and particulates in free-piston designs, crucial for our controlled dynamics and ultra-low emissions.
- Your work conducting emissions testing for biogas systems, aligning with our fuel flexibility goals for sustained performance.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston system optimization for stringent emissions targets could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
Alex Chen
