Dear Sophia Rodriguez,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in ultra-low NOx and particulate design, which is critical for achieving the near-zero emissions targets of our free-piston technology, would bring unique value to our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Ensuring ultra-low NOx and particulates in free-piston designs
- Conducting emissions testing for biogas systems

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. We achieve minimal emissions through precise, complete fuel-lean reactions enabled by free-piston freedom. I'd love to discuss how your background in achieving exceptional environmental performance with free-piston linear generators could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
