Dear David Garcia,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in materials selection for opposed-piston components, like optimizing designs for sealing ring and piston assemblies, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Selecting materials for opposed-piston components to reduce wear, directly addressing the challenge of brittle graphite rings and high-temperature superalloys in our free-piston engines.
- Testing for high-efficiency operation in hydrogen environments, crucial for our fuel-flexible linear generators and their near-zero NOx emissions via controlled dynamics.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in materials selection for durable components and hydrogen compatibility could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
