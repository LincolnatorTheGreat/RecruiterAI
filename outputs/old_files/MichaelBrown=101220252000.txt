Dear Michael Brown,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in thermal analysis, like opposed-piston assemblies, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your experience with thermal analysis on opposed-piston assemblies using ANSYS
- Your optimization of low-temperature combustion for ultra-low NOx

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving near-zero NOx through precise, low-temperature combustion. I'd love to discuss how your background in the design and analysis of piston and ring systems could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
