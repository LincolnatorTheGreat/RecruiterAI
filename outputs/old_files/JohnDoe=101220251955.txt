Dear John Doe,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in designing free-piston prototypes, like thermal analysis of complex piston systems, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Assisting in the design of free-piston prototypes for hydrogen fuel systems
- Performing thermal analysis and combustion modeling for high-temperature piston environments

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, where our dual opposed pistons oscillate linearly without mechanical constraints. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston prototype design and thermal analysis could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
