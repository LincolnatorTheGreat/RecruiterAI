Dear Sarah Lee,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **real-time control software**, like **piston motion control in free-piston linear generators**, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your software development for piston motion control in free-piston linear generators, crucial for the precise operation of our opposed-piston systems.
- Your integration of Python scripts for adaptive compression ratios, directly impacting the high-pressure, high-temperature environment our sealing rings endure.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving near-zero NOx through precise, software-managed combustion and dynamic compression via real-time piston positioning. I'd love to discuss how your background in **software-driven free-piston dynamics** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
