Dear Robert Wilson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in R&D on ammonia-fueled free-piston systems, like developing reliable free-piston systems for low-carbon fuels, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- leading R&D on ammonia-fueled free-piston systems
- ensuring reliability under variable loads for generator technology

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, enabling ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston generator R&D and low-carbon fuel integration could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
