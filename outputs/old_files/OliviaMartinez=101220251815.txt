Dear Olivia Martinez,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in systems integration, particularly in optimizing the integration of free-piston generators, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your direct experience integrating free-piston generators into multi-MW systems, which gives you a valuable systems-level perspective.
- Your demonstrated ability to manage grid responsiveness and design for low maintenance, crucial for ensuring our linear generators' high availability and extended service intervals, a direct goal for our ring assemblies.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, demanding ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics. I'd love to discuss how your background in the demanding operational environment of free-piston linear generator systems could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
Alex Chen
