Dear Olivia Martinez,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **systems integration of free-piston generators**, like **our free-piston linear generator with its dual opposed pistons**, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work **integrating free-piston generators into multi-MW systems**, which provides invaluable insight into their operational demands and overall architecture.
- Your focus on **managing grid responsiveness and low-maintenance designs**, a critical area for our Rings team as we strive for high availability and extended service intervals.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, delivering ultra-low emissions through precise controlled dynamics. I'd love to discuss how your background in **systems integration for dispatchable power solutions** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
