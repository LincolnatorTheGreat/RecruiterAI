Dear Robert A. DaSilva,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in advanced Finite Element Analysis (FEA), particularly analyzing component life and vibratory response in high-pressure, high-temperature environments, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Leading R&D projects from concept through production, utilizing advanced materials like composites, directly aligns with our graphite ring development challenges.
- Optimizing component life and troubleshooting failure modes under extreme thermal and vibratory conditions is essential for our linearly oscillating piston assemblies.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. Our free-piston architecture enables direct conversion of linear motion into electricity with reduced components, minimizing maintenance, a critical goal your background supports. I'd love to discuss how your background in complex mechanical design, advanced material analysis, and product development in extreme environments could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
