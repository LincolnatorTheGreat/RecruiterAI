Dear Emily Davis,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in free-piston units, specifically related to our cutting-edge free-piston linear generator technology, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your experience building and testing modular free-piston units from kW to MW scale is directly relevant to designing and validating the complex piston and ring systems central to our generators.
- Your collaboration on biogas and ammonia fuel prototypes aligns perfectly with our focus on fuel-flexible operation and achieving ultra-low emissions, which are critical considerations for ring performance in our dual opposed piston architecture.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems that oscillate linearly without mechanical linkages, delivering >50% efficient power with near-zero NOx. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston linear generator technology could drive our next-gen ring assembly innovations. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
