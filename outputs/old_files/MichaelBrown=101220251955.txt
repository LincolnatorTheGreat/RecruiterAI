Dear Michael Brown,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **thermal analysis of opposed-piston systems**, like our **opposed pistons without mechanical linkages**, would be a game-changer for our **Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings** role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your **thermal analysis expertise for opposed-piston assemblies**, which is crucial for optimizing our high-pressure, high-temperature piston and ring designs.
- Your **optimization of low-temperature combustion for ultra-low emissions**, directly supporting our breakthrough for near-zero NOx.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in **high-temperature, opposed-piston ring systems** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
