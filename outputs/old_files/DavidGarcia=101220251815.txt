Dear David Garcia,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in materials selection, like opposed-piston components, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Selecting materials for opposed-piston components to reduce wear, directly addressing critical challenges in our ring and piston assemblies.
- Your expertise in high-efficiency operation within hydrogen environments, aligning with our linear generator's fuel flexibility.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power. I'd love to discuss how your background in materials science for advanced free-piston generator components could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
[Your Dad's Name]
