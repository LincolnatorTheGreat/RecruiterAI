Dear Kidus,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in conducting structural analysis using FEA tools and designing systems for high-temperature and high-vibration environments, which would be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your strong background in `conducting static and dynamic structural analysis using FEA tools and designing for durability, fatigue, and long-term reliability`.
- Your extensive experience in `designing systems for high-temperature environments, as seen with solid oxide cell hotboxes, and leading prototyping, testing, and validation` through the product lifecycle.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires innovative exhaust system designs that effectively manage outputs from our unique flameless reaction, withstand extreme temperatures and high vibrations, and integrate critical emissions and acoustic control within a compact system.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
