Dear Alex Johnson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in linear generators, like opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Designing linear alternators for free-piston generators
- Conducting electromagnetic simulations for hydrogen-compatible systems

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, enabling ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston generator technology and hydrogen fuel compatibility could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
David Chen
