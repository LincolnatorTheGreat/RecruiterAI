Dear Michael Brown,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in thermal analysis and optimization, like opposed-piston assemblies and low-temperature combustion, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your thermal analysis on opposed-piston assemblies using ANSYS, crucial for designs operating in multiphysical high-pressure and temperature environments.
- Your optimization of low-temperature combustion for ultra-low NOx, directly supporting our near-zero emissions goals and free-piston control dynamics.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving near-zero NOx through precise, complete fuel-lean reactions. I'd love to discuss how your background in advanced free-piston thermal and combustion dynamics could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
