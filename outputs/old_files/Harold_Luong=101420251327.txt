Dear Harold,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in the design and development of complex mechanical hardware, and expertise with graphite composite and metallic components, which relates directly to Mainspring Energy's innovative piston and ring system, crucial for the linear generator's ultra-low emissions and durability, and would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive background in the design, development, qualification, and manufacturing of high-performance mechanical hardware, including complex metallic and graphite composite components
- Your experience leading design reviews, iterating product designs, and conducting materials evaluations and fatigue studies, which is directly relevant to troubleshooting and optimizing component durability in extreme conditions

The challenge is that our linear generator's rings must contain pressures far in excess of 100 bar and withstand gas temperatures up to 1500C, while being made from brittle graphite and high-temperature superalloys. Ensuring the long-term durability and oil-free, low-emission operation of these critical assemblies requires expert design, analysis, and root cause investigation.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
