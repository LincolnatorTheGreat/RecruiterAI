Dear Jane Smith,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in software-driven motion systems, like opposed-piston linear generators, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Developed real-time control algorithms for opposed-piston linear generators
- Optimized low-temperature combustion using Python and Simulink

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, where dual opposed pistons oscillate linearly without mechanical constraints. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston linear generator control and optimization could drive our next-gen prototypes and help us achieve minimal emissions through precise, software-managed low-temperature combustion. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
