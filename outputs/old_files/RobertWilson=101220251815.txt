Dear Robert Wilson,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in free-piston systems development, particularly with advanced fuels like ammonia, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Leading R&D on ammonia-fueled free-piston systems
- Ensuring reliability of generator operation under variable loads

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, utilizing controlled dynamics for ultra-low emissions. I'd love to discuss how your background in free-piston linear generator technology and low-carbon fuels could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
