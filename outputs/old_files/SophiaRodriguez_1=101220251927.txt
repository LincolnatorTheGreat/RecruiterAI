Dear Sophia Rodriguez,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in **low-emission free-piston designs**, like **our focus on near-zero NOx and particulate outputs**, would be a game-changer for our **Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings** role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work ensuring **ultra-low NOx and particulates in free-piston designs**, directly aligning with our goal for oil-free, low-emissions operation.
- Your experience conducting **emissions testing for biogas systems**, which speaks to our fuel flexibility and commitment to rigorous validation.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, achieving **minimal emissions** through precise control. I'd love to discuss how your background in **low-emission free-piston technology** could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
