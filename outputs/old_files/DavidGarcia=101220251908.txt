Dear David Garcia,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with Mainspring Energy's free-piston linear generator innovationâ€”your expertise in materials engineering for durable components, like opposed-piston components, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your work selecting materials for opposed-piston components to reduce wear.
- Your experience testing for high-efficiency operation in hydrogen environments.

At Mainspring, we're scaling opposed-piston systems for fuel-flexible, >50% efficient power, enabling ultra-low emissions through precisely controlled dynamics. Our Rings team is critical to this, designing robust components for our unique opposed pistons without mechanical linkages, which ensures oil-free, low-emissions operation. I'd love to discuss how your background in material optimization for advanced free-piston systems could drive our next-gen prototypes. Available for a quick 15-minute chat?

Warm regards,
