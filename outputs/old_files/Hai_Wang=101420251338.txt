Dear Hai,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in Finite Element Analysis (FEA), thermo-mechanical coupling analysis that relates to the critical piston and ring assemblies within our linear generator technology, and would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your expertise in designing complex moving parts and conducting structural FEA in multiphysical environments
- Your deep experience modeling material behaviors at high temperatures and simulating fracture, wear, and contact

The challenge is that our linear generator requires optimizing the durability of piston seals and moving components, which must contain pressures over 100 bar and temperatures up to 1500C while operating oil-free and minimizing wear of graphite rings.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
