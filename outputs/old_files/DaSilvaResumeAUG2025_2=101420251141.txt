Dear Robert,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in structural FEA, machine design, and material science that relates to Mainspring Energy's advanced piston seal assembly design for free-piston linear generators, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Extensive experience in CAD and structural FEA for optimizing complex mechanical designs, including high-temperature metallic structures.
- Proven ability in designing test campaigns, evaluating component life, and troubleshooting complex failure modes involving thermal, structural, and material interactions.

The challenge is that our linear generator's ring and piston assemblies must operate under extreme conditions—pressures exceeding 100 bar, temperatures up to 1500C, and high-speed linear oscillation—all while ensuring the longevity of brittle graphite seals for extended service intervals.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short, 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
