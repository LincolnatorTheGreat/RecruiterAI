Dear Pantcho,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in tribological materials and clearance, and sliding friction and wear phenomena that relates to Mainspring Energy's unique free-piston linear generator technology, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your expertise in tribological materials and designing for extreme environmental conditions, crucial for our piston and ring system operating at pressures exceeding 100 bar and temperatures up to 1500C.
- Your extensive background in understanding and mitigating sliding friction and wear phenomena, directly addressing the durability challenges of our graphite piston rings.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires designing, analyzing, and optimizing oil-free sealing ring and piston assemblies for ultra-long service intervals and maintaining ultra-low emissions through controlled dynamics.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short, 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
