Dear Robert,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in high-temperature material science and advanced Finite Element Analysis (FEA), like designing durable sealing ring and piston assemblies for extreme operating conditions within our linear generator, would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your proven track record in the design and analysis of complex moving parts, specifically turbine engine rings and components, including structural FEA for high-pressure and high-temperature environments.
- Your deep expertise in root cause investigations and predicting component life for thermal mechanical fatigue, creep, and vibratory response, essential for extending the service intervals of critical sealing components.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires optimizing sealing ring and piston assemblies to withstand extreme pressures and temperatures (100 bar, 1500C), while combating wear and oxidation of brittle graphite materials to extend service intervals in an oil-free, low-emission linear generator.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short, 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
