Hi Kidus,

I came across your profile and was immediately struck by how closely your background aligns with our work at Mainspring Energy. Your expertise in designing and developing mechanical components and systems for high-temperature environments, along with your strength in structural analysis using FEA tools and design for manufacturability (DFM/DFA/GD&T), directly connects to the challenges we're tackling with our Linear Generator technology, which relies on precise control of its core components for ultra-low emissions. Your skill set could be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

What stood out from your experience:

*   Your experience designing and developing complex mechanical and electromechanical components for high-temperature systems, such such as solid oxide cell hotboxes, from concept to production.
*   Your proficiency in conducting static and dynamic structural analysis using FEA tools, coupled with hands-on prototyping, testing, and DFM/DFA expertise.

The opportunity:
Our Linear Generator requires designing low-emission exhaust subsystems that withstand extreme temperatures, high vibrations, and integrate advanced acoustic-damping and emissions control technologies.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute chat?

Best regards,
