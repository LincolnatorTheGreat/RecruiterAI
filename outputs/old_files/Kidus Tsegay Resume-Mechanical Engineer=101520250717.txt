Dear Kidus,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in designing components for high-temperature/high-vibration environments and your proficiency in structural analysis and durability design, which relates directly to Mainspring Energy's Linear Generator's exhaust system, and would be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive experience in designing and validating mechanical and electromechanical components for systems operating in high-temperature environments, as seen with the electrolyzer hotbox and LED heat sinks.
- Your proficiency in structural analysis (FEA/ANSYS), durability design, and hands-on prototyping and testing for critical hardware.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires optimizing exhaust system performance, ensuring durability in high-vibration environments, and integrating advanced emissions control and acoustic-damping technologies to maintain our ultra-low emissions profile.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
