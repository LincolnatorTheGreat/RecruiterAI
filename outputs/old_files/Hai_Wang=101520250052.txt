Dear Hai,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in Finite Element Analysis, multi-physics structural analysis that relates to Mainspring Energy's linear generator piston and ring systems, and would be a game-changer for our Staff Mechanical Engineer - Rings role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your extensive experience in structural FEA and multi-physics simulations, particularly with wear and thermo-mechanical coupling
- Your expertise in modeling material behaviors at high temperatures, including brittle materials and superalloys

The challenge is that our linear generator requires optimizing the durability of our unique graphite rings and piston assemblies, which must endure extreme pressures (far in excess of 100 bar) and high temperatures (up to 1500C) in an oil-free environment. This is central to achieving ultra-low emissions via controlled dynamics and extending service intervals.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
