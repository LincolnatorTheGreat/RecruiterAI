Hi Kidus,

I came across your profile and was immediately struck by how closely your background aligns with our work at Mainspring Energy. Your expertise in mechanical component design, FEA, and GD&T, along with your strength in designing systems for high-temperature and high-vibration environments, directly connects to the challenges we're tackling for our Linear Generator's exhaust system. Your skill set could be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations. Our unique flameless reaction process achieves ultra-low emissions, making the exhaust system a critical innovation area.

The opportunity:
We are advancing our Linear Generator's low-emission exhaust subsystems, tackling complex challenges in performance, acoustics, and structural design within high-temperature, high-vibration environments, crucial for our ultra-low emission flameless reaction process.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute chat?

Best regards,
