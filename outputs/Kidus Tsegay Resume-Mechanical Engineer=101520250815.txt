Dear Kidus,

I was reviewing your profile and immediately saw a strong alignment with your expertise in designing for durability, fatigue, and long-term reliability, and experience with high-temperature mechanical systems that relates to Mainspring Energy's need for a robust exhaust system for our linear generator, and would be a game-changer for our Senior Mechanical Engineer - Exhaust System role.

At Mainspring Energy, we’re transforming how power is generated with our breakthrough Linear Generator — a fuel-flexible, low-emission platform that’s redefining local power generation for data centers, EV charging, commercial facilities, and grid-scale operations.

Key aspects from your experience that resonate:
- Your strong background in designing systems for high-temperature and high-vibration environments, demonstrated through your work on solid oxide cell hotboxes and heat exchangers.
- Your proficiency in structural analysis (FEA), mechanical component design (Solidworks, GD&T), and managing products from concept to production, including rigorous validation and testing.

The challenge is that our linear generator requires innovative exhaust system design to achieve ultra-low emissions and effective acoustic damping while ensuring durability and high performance in demanding environments.

I’d love to share more context about the opportunity and learn about your interests. Would you be available for a short 20-minute confidential chat?

Best regards,
